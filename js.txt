let book = `quick brown fox`
let author = `Stacy`

//getting characters
Individual character with an string block
console.log(result[0])

//Length

console.log(result[6])
passwords

 //Upercasing text
 console.log(firstname.toLocalUpperCase())

** - power %- rmeinder BIDMAS I stands for power
let radius = 33;
